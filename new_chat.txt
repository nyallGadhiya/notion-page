[25/09/24, 09:48:58] ~ Wise: One key point that you should know as advanced investor is the concept of stock buybacks. 

In simple words: buy-backs mean-- the firm buying its own shares. 

This is done for multiple reasons: to generate confidence in stock, if the firm has too much cash etc. 

To us as investors, it helps: because the firm itself has the potential to create a counter-buyer position. And, this ensures that the stock price won't fall much 

[1] For eg. firms like Apple/Google etc are right now cash rich firms 
[2] One of the key reason why the stock price of these firms keeps going up is 
[3] They buy their own stocks from open market when it falls (using the cash) and brings the stock price back up 

This is an oversimplified explanation that I am giving. 
But, it is important to know 

I had explained more details on my last video reg the same: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTBX0M5fkg4
[25/09/24, 10:10:37] ~ Wise: Overview of different investment options, end of September 2024: 

[1] Private Bank ETF has hits its technical levels now. But, on a long-term fundamental basis, it is undervalued (can be added more, if you are not maxed out)
[2] IT Index fairly valued (I am not adding more) 
[3] BTC, I am adding 1 more round of bulk buy (then I stay put) 
[4] NIFTY Pharma has given a 100% rally in the last 1 year. Some folks are saying that it is still undervalued, honestly I am not completely convinced. So I am not adding/selling anything 
[5] Smallcap Index, looks risky now. Have sold NIFTY 250 Smallcap. But, building select positions in cash rich small cap firms (some names already discussed yesterday) 
[6] While consumer durable stocks have given a good run up. But, if we check the consumer durables Index: it has only given a 35%-40% run up in the last 3 years. This is not much. 
[7] #6 seems like a contrarian bet. And I am okay taking it. I am buying Consumer Durable Index via Mutual Fund route (there are some very low expense ones) 
[8] US stocks, I am investing more more. To be sufficiently diversified. Simplest bet to take right now is: NASDAQ, it is not overvalued. Might be a good swing over the next 6-8 months. 

PS: Not any recommendations, just sharing my research.
[26/09/24, 09:46:48] ~ Wise: Hello Folks, I am adding more US stocks to my portfolio. Will share the details. 

Meanwhile there a few very important points to understand, which will help you pick the right set of stocks, with the right thesis:- 

What dictates the stock market price movement is: WHERE the money is being spent. This comprises of 3 parts:

[1] Consumer spending: (check the chart attached) 

- Unlike India, in the US, the consumer spending grows almost linearly. Reason is: the savings rate in the economy is low/ people are geared towards spending 
- It is only the "mix" of spending that changes 
- When the economy is growing-- they spend more on discretionary/luxury; when the economy is shrinking: they spend on basics 
- Fairly common sensical 

[2] Government spending: 

* US government spends most money on social security programs 
* This translates into high prices for Insurance, Health/research 
* There would be other impact: but hard to link it directly to Government spending 
* This is again very unlike India, where things are still in a nascent stage -- and government pretty much decides to growth outcomes. 

[3] Buy backs: 
* When a firm buys it own stocks (in simple words it means that it can support its own price) 
* Apple is likely to do this / already doing this 

These are the reasons why, we should bet on: (in the US) 
- Cash rich tech firms (they can do buybacks easily) 
- Healthcare/biotech/Insurance health (government spending) 
- Consumer discretionary (gets support due to private spending) 
- Utilities/RE and all are cyclical. And, I would generally avoid this in the US 
- Financials too are left with very little product innovation/penetration at this stage (better to bet on Indian financials)
[26/09/24, 09:48:18] ~ Wise: If you had missed the last LIVE class, it is fine. I will do another one soon :) 

Will cover these points in more details. 

We will also talk about Dividend Portfolio strategy in the US. 

Just FYI: attending live classes, is one of the exclusive perks of this community :)
[26/09/24, 11:38:46] ~ Wise: Here are stocks in which I would do SIPs (if I do SIP). And, some key points you should know (to do proper SIPs) 

(1) Pick industries/stocks that grow faster than Nifty 50. So our target CAGR should at least be 15% 
(2) I would not need this money for 3-5 years. This will I will see 1 swing cycle 
(3) I would do step-up; step-down SIPs (to generate a certain alpha) 
(4) I would pick cash rich firms, which can grow at 15% CAGR 
(5) Criteria for 15% CAGR would be: 15% ROIC, 15% Cash Flow growth, 15% expansion oriented growth 
(6) Should be relatively safer firm (market leader or near market leader) 
(7) The collective SIP portfolio should be balanced 

So using these filters, I could pick these firms: 

- IDFC First Bank 
- HDFC Bank 
- Kotak Mahindra
- Angel One 
- CDSL/CAMS
- CRISIL 
- Aptus Value Housing 
- PI Industries (won't buy it now, will buy it at 200DMA) 
- HUL (again, buy at 200DMA) 
- Asian Paints 
- Indigo Paints 
- HDFC Life 
- Max Hospital 
- Apollo 
- TCS/Infy 

Every month you can pick 10 stocks from this list. And, check if they are at sensible levels. Will keep updating the group :) 

Hope this helps! 
And, I am glad with all the messages you guys keep sharing, 
Means a lot that you consider me a partner in this wealth building journey, appreciate :)

[27/09/24, 09:15:20] ~ Wise: When I made the video on Swiggy Pre-IPO, many folks bashed me. But, that is not the topic of this post. 

This post is about understanding risk-reward with a real example of Swiggy. 

We bought Swiggy pre-IPO at around 11Bn$ valuation. 
Swiggy yesterday announced that they will target 13-15Bn$ valuation 

This gives us roughly a 20% upside, just from the fair valuation size. 
Add to this: IPO frenzy Euphoria and 100 different things, there can be a good chance of a gain. 

The point of bulk buying is always to identify good opportunity, invest at a good intrinsic value and stay put. 

Yes, we can't liquidate our Swiggy stocks till 6 months post IPO. 
But, please remember: neither can many other core investors. 
So no special rules are being built for us :) 

Now, folks are asking: should I buy Swiggy now? 
Ans) I don't know. It is not at a 20% discount anymore. You are basically betting on IPO euphoria. 

Having a 20% margin of safety allows you to bulk invest. 
If you wish to invest in Swiggy now, you need to run your analysis in some other way.

[27/09/24, 21:45:46] ~ Wise: * Chinese stock market in the last 6 months has given around 25% run up. 
* Investing in Chinese equities could prove to be the trade of this decade 
* In fact, I build a bit of positions; then stopped. Here is the breakdown:- 
* China Market before 2008 (more specifically late 90s to 2008) was growing from a low income to a mid income country 
* This happened very fast for China
* One key thing that moved the needle was to bring foreign investors into their markets via (stock ownerships) 
* But after 2008, 2 key things changed: 
* One, the US started abusing the money system (by QE) they were releasing US$ into the world's economy 
* Most of the US$ that was coming in the Chinese economy was being backed by this excess $ printing 
* The Chinese government started looking at this with suspicion. They started considering pumping of US$ into Chinese stocks as an indirect control by VC/PE funds, especially BlackRock 
* So they started getting stricter with who could own Chinese equities; this got to the point where we saw the Jack Ma case play out, where he was (one could argue kidnapped for speaking his mind) 
* The 2nd key change was the collapse of China's RE market and migration of Chinese Money 
* Up until 2020, Rich Chinese used to buy RE (As much as they could) -- this was there primary way to invest (why? no other major investment options) 
* But by 2022 the RE bubble burst: there was just too much supply and very few takers. One could argue that China grew really really fast 
* As a result: many Chinese investors started moving money to anywhere they could: right from Thailand, Dubai etc. This got to a point where the Chinese government recently had to ban Chinese folks from buying property abroad. 
* So back to 2024: the Chinese RE is down. Rich investors need to invest somewhere. Their options are limited. And, looks like the Chinese government is reviving its stock markets again 
* On a macro note: if you look at the chart, you will see how cyclical the Chinese market is.
